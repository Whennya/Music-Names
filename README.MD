# Music Names

This repository stores music name and lyric configs for Zombie Escape and Zombie Survival maps. These configs are currently used on [Sunrust](https://sunrust.org/).

> [!NOTE]
> Music configs under the `legacy` folder were configs used on zeddy's, which followed an old config format. Only use this folder to find names of music.

## Config Formatting

### Music Name

```yaml
"music"
{
    "filename.mp3" "Artist - Title"
    "level1_boss.mp3" "Pendulum - The Tempest (Live at Brixton Academy)"
    "level2_boss.mp3" "Pendulum - Slam"
}
```

### Lyrics

```lua
GM.ZELyrics = {
    ["filename.mp3"] = {
        {time = 1.0, text = "Example of lyric at 1 second"},
        {time = 2.4, text = "Example of lyric at 2.4 seconds"},
        {time = 3.0, text = "Example of holding text until next lyric shows up", autohold = true},
        {time = 5.0, text = "This text will clear previous text at 5.0 seconds,"},
    },
    ["filename2.mp3"] = {
        {time = 1.0, text = "Example of a second song and lyrics"},
        {time = 3.0, text = "Put as many text for any lyrics"},
    },
}
```

## Config Guidelines

> [!CAUTION]
> File extensions must be **included** *(such as `.mp3`)* for music to be detected and displayed

> [!CAUTION]
> File names must be **lowercase**

- Follow `<Artist> - <Song Title>` format
- Use `//` to add comments to configs
- Add extra song details if needed (e.g. `"Pendulum - The Tempest (Live at Brixton Academy)"`)
- Song names in other languages are fine, but try to keep english names if there is one
- For files that contain multiple songs, please follow this format: `Artist - Title 1, Artist 2 - Title 2, Artist 3 - Title 3` and so on
- Custom music added externally should also be included (may require further access to stripper configs)
